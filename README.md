# oapi-hydra
This repository holds experiments to create OGC API (OAPI) [Common Specification](https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common) using [Hydra Core Vocabulary](https://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/) to provide a more convenient linked-data accessible/traversable form of the specification. The first service specification that the OGC has published is the [OGC API - Features -Part 1: Core, First Draft Release](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html) and has an [openapi YAML specification document](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/blob/master/core/openapi/ogcapi-features-1.yaml) in the [OGC API - Features](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features).
